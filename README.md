<!-- Presentation -->
<p>
  
Hello! My name is Rodolpho Miranda, and I’m currently transitioning into the tech field, with a focus on *Data Analysis* and *Back-end Development*. I have a diverse professional background, having worked in London as a Whole Foods Market cleaner, MSK labourer,*grocery stocker* and Deliveroo rider (cyclist). At present, I work as a stock assistant at Carrefour, but I am fully committed to building a new career in technology.\
I’m also an amateur writer and illustrator — creative talents that I’ve developed as hobbies, but which I aim to incorporate into my professional path, particularly in areas such as design, technical writing, and user interfaces. I believe this blend of creativity and analytical thinking will be a valuable asset throughout my journey.\
My intention is, *a priori*, to start studying Data Analysis, focusing on tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Python. My next step is to dive deeper into frameworks, APIs, servers, cybersecurity, version control, and advanced Python programming, laying a strong foundation for a Back-end developer role. Later on, I plan to complement this with studies in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UX/UI, also leveraging my artistic skills to confidently contribute on the Front-end when needed.\
In short, my goal, *a posteriori*, is to become a Python Full-Stack Developer with solid expertise in Data Analysis and a creative approach to technical problem-solving.\
I’m just beginning this journey, but I’m highly motivated and excited for what’s ahead.

<!--Intro-->               
<p align="left"> "Santander – Excel with Artificial Intelligence (Copilot)" was a bootcamp offered through the DIO e-learning platform. With a total duration of approximately 26 hours, spread across 16 video lessons and practical assessments, the course focused on introducing and enhancing the basic use of Microsoft Excel, including integration with artificial intelligence features via Copilot AI.
A course centred on the strong foundational principles of Excel, including an introduction to the interface and basic functionalities, as well as progress in the initial processing and analysis of data in tables. I also developed skills in the creation and formatting of tables with conditional and validated data, the use of basic formulas, and the design of interactive dashboards, enabling clearer data visualisation and interpretation.
Finally, the initial use of Copilot, a tool that supports automation and task optimisation within Excel, representing a significant advantage in data analysis with the aid of artificial intelligence.</p>

# Personal Works

## On my Writings
*Little-Boy e o Reino de Alphômega* (in Portuguese) is a coming-of-age fantasy tale that immerses the reader in a universe of adventure, imagination, and inner discovery.

Inspired by the legendary echoes of the *Arthurian Cycle* and steeped in the rich tapestry of European folklore, this book goes even further, transforming itself into the vibrant hues and mysteries of *Amerindian mythology* – crafting a new world where the ancient and the modern intertwine like never before.

📚 At first glance, it may appear to be a simple children’s story. Yet beneath its enchanted surface lies a profound, daring, and literarily innovative narrative, written in a modernist and experimental style, tailored for a young audience unafraid of being challenged. These readers will encounter techniques such as:

- •	🌊 Stream of consciousness,
- •	🧠 Interior monologue,
- •	🗣️ Inventive neologisms,
- •	🌍 Subtle social commentary interwoven throughout.
  
With a language that both provokes and inspires, *Little-Boy and the Alphômega Kingdom* is a journey that invites the reader to grow alongside its protagonist.

## On my drawings
Drawing has always been one of my passions.
I consider myself specialised in realistic pencil portraits. While drawing has mostly been a hobby, my dedication and keen eye for detail have made me – modesty aside – something of a specialist in the art of capturing human expressions.

In addition to mastering graphite, I also have a certain level of expertise in digital drawing, particularly using *Photoshop* – blending the tradition of pencil and paper with the innovation of technology.

I must admit, I’m a bit rusty.
Life's everyday hustle kept me away from the sketchpad for quite some time... but the desire to return is stronger than ever – and now, with a new purpose: to apply my artistic talent within the tech world.

I’m ready to dive headfirst into areas such as marketing, advertising, web design, branding, and UI/UX design, bringing my artistic perspective to creative and impactful projects.

If you're looking for a unique artistic touch – stay tuned.
