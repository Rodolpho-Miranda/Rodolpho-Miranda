<p>
  
Hello! My name is Rodolpho Miranda, and I‚Äôm currently transitioning into the tech field, with a focus on *Data Analysis* and *Back-end Development*. I have a diverse professional background, having worked in London as a Whole Foods Market cleaner, MSK labourer,*grocery stocker* and Deliveroo rider (cyclist). At present, I work as a stock assistant at Carrefour, but I am fully committed to building a new career in technology.\
I‚Äôm also an amateur writer and illustrator ‚Äî creative talents that I‚Äôve developed as hobbies, but which I aim to incorporate into my professional path, particularly in areas such as design, technical writing, and user interfaces. I believe this blend of creativity and analytical thinking will be a valuable asset throughout my journey.\
My intention is, *a priori*, to start studying Data Analysis, focusing on tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Python. My next step is to dive deeper into frameworks, APIs, servers, cybersecurity, version control, and advanced Python programming, laying a strong foundation for a Back-end developer role. Later on, I plan to complement this with studies in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UX/UI, also leveraging my artistic skills to confidently contribute on the Front-end when needed.\
In short, my goal, *a posteriori*, is to become a Python Full-Stack Developer with solid expertise in Data Analysis and a creative approach to technical problem-solving.\
I‚Äôm just beginning this journey, but I‚Äôm highly motivated and excited for what‚Äôs ahead. 


## üöß Under Construction: My Tech Journey
### üéØ Goals in the Tech Field
-	**Short term**: Studying tools such as Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Python to begin working with Data Analysis.
-	**Medium term**: Deepening my knowledge in Frameworks, APIs, servers, security, version control, and advanced Python, with a focus on Back-end development.
-	**Long term**: Expanding into Front-end with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UX/UI, combining logic with creativity.
My ultimate goal is to become a Python Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in data and creativity as a technical and visual differentiator.

### üíª Technologies and Tools I Intend to Study From Now Onwards
-	**Data Analysis**: Excel | Power BI | Tableau | SQL | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
-	**Back-end**: Advanced Python | APIs | Security | Version Control (Git/GitHub) | Servers
-	**Front-end (future)**: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | UX/UI
-	**Other**: Technical Communication | Creative Writing | Digital Illustration

### üìå My Goals
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Short term**: Work with Data Analysis
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Medium term**: Become a Back-end Developer with Python
- ‚úîÔ∏è **Long term**: Transition to Full Stack, combining creativity with technology

<!--Intro-->               
<p align="left"> "Santander ‚Äì Excel with Artificial Intelligence (Copilot)" was a bootcamp offered through the DIO e-learning platform. With a total duration of approximately 26 hours, spread across 16 video lessons and practical assessments, the course focused on introducing and enhancing the basic use of Microsoft Excel, including integration with artificial intelligence features via Copilot AI.
A course centred on the strong foundational principles of Excel, including an introduction to the interface and basic functionalities, as well as progress in the initial processing and analysis of data in tables. I also developed skills in the creation and formatting of tables with conditional and validated data, the use of basic formulas, and the design of interactive dashboards, enabling clearer data visualisation and interpretation.
Finally, the initial use of Copilot, a tool that supports automation and task optimisation within Excel, representing a significant advantage in data analysis with the aid of artificial intelligence.</p>
